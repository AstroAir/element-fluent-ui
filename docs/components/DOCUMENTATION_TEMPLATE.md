# FluentComponent Documentation Template

This template provides a standardized structure for documenting Element Fluent UI components with comprehensive, standalone examples.

## Template Structure

Each component documentation should follow this structure:

### 1. Header and Overview
- Component name and brief description
- Key features and capabilities
- Visual preview or diagram

### 2. Quick Start
- Basic usage example
- Minimal setup code
- Import statements

### 3. Standalone Examples

#### 3.1 Basic Usage Examples
- Simple component creation
- Default configuration
- Common use cases

#### 3.2 Configuration Examples
- Property variations
- Style options
- Size and appearance settings

#### 3.3 State Examples
- Different component states (normal, hover, disabled, etc.)
- Interactive state changes
- Loading and error states

#### 3.4 Event Handling Examples
- Signal/slot connections
- User interaction handling
- Custom event responses

### 4. Advanced Usage

#### 4.1 Integration Examples
- Component combinations
- Layout integration
- Parent-child relationships

#### 4.2 Customization Examples
- Custom styling
- Theme integration
- Advanced configuration

### 5. Accessibility Examples
- ARIA attributes
- Keyboard navigation
- Screen reader support
- High contrast mode

### 6. Responsive Design Examples
- Different screen sizes
- Mobile adaptations
- Flexible layouts

### 7. Theming Examples
- Light/dark theme variations
- Custom theme colors
- Theme switching

### 8. Real-World Scenarios
- Form integration
- Dashboard usage
- Navigation patterns
- Data display

### 9. Performance Considerations
- Optimization tips
- Memory usage
- Rendering performance

### 10. API Reference
- Properties and methods
- Signals and slots
- Enums and constants

### 11. Best Practices
- Usage guidelines
- Common patterns
- Pitfalls to avoid

### 12. Related Components
- Cross-references
- Component combinations
- Alternative options

## Example Code Standards

### Code Block Format
```cpp
#include "FluentQt/Components/FluentComponent.h"

// Clear, descriptive comments
auto* component = new FluentComponent(this);

// Show property configuration
component->setProperty("value", true);
component->setSize(FluentSize::Medium);

// Demonstrate signal connections
connect(component, &FluentComponent::clicked, [=]() {
    qDebug() << "Component clicked!";
});

// Layout integration
layout->addWidget(component);
```

### Example Requirements
1. **Self-contained**: Each example should run independently
2. **Commented**: Clear explanations of what each line does
3. **Complete**: Include all necessary headers and setup
4. **Practical**: Show real-world usage scenarios
5. **Progressive**: Start simple, build complexity

### Visual Examples
- Include screenshots or diagrams where helpful
- Show before/after states
- Demonstrate responsive behavior
- Illustrate theme variations

## Documentation Guidelines

### Writing Style
- Use clear, concise language
- Provide context for each example
- Explain the "why" not just the "how"
- Include troubleshooting tips

### Code Quality
- Follow project coding standards
- Use meaningful variable names
- Include error handling where appropriate
- Show both C++ and QML examples when applicable

### Organization
- Logical progression from basic to advanced
- Group related examples together
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Provide easy navigation between sections

## Template Checklist

When documenting a component, ensure:

- [ ] Overview explains component purpose and key features
- [ ] Quick start example is minimal and functional
- [ ] At least 5 standalone basic examples
- [ ] Property variations are demonstrated
- [ ] All component states are shown
- [ ] Event handling examples are included
- [ ] Accessibility features are documented
- [ ] Responsive behavior is demonstrated
- [ ] Theming examples are provided
- [ ] Real-world scenarios are included
- [ ] Performance considerations are mentioned
- [ ] API reference is complete
- [ ] Best practices are documented
- [ ] Related components are cross-referenced
- [ ] All code examples are tested and functional
- [ ] Visual aids are included where helpful

## Next Steps

This template will be used to enhance documentation for all 49 components in the Element Fluent UI library, ensuring consistent, comprehensive, and practical documentation that helps developers effectively use each component.
