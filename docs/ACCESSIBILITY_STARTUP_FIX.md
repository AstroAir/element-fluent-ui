# FluentQt Accessibility Startup Fix

## Issue Description

FluentQtDemo was freezing/hanging during startup at "Detecting system accessibility settings" after "FluentAccessibilityManager initialized" was displayed. This was caused by synchronous Windows registry access during accessibility initialization that could block the UI thread.

## Root Cause Analysis

The freeze was caused by:

1. **Synchronous Registry Access**: `FluentAccessibilityComplianceManager::detectSystemAccessibilitySettings()` was making synchronous calls to Windows registry during initialization
2. **Blocking Process Detection**: `FluentScreenReaderManager::detectScreenReader()` was spawning processes and calling `waitForFinished()` synchronously
3. **Windows API Calls**: `FindWindow()` calls for assistive technology detection were blocking the UI thread
4. **Blocking UI Thread**: All detection operations were happening on the main UI thread during startup
5. **Auto-initialization**: The accessibility system was being initialized automatically via `Q_CONSTRUCTOR_FUNCTION` which runs during module loading
6. **Multiple Detection Calls**: System detection was being called from multiple places without proper coordination

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Asynchronous System Detection

- **Made registry access asynchronous**: Moved system detection to use `QTimer::singleShot()` to defer execution to the next event loop iteration
- **Added async methods**: Created `detectSystemAccessibilitySettingsAsync()` methods in both `FluentAccessibilityManager` and `FluentAccessibilityComplianceManager`
- **Deferred initialization**: System detection now happens after the UI thread is free

### 2. Enhanced Error Handling

- **Try-catch blocks**: Wrapped all registry operations in try-catch blocks to handle access failures gracefully
- **Fallback defaults**: Provide sensible default values if registry access fails
- **Timeout protection**: Registry operations now have implicit timeout protection through async execution

### 3. Environment Variable Support

- **Added skip option**: New environment variable `FLUENTQT_SKIP_ACCESSIBILITY_DETECTION` to skip system detection entirely
- **Consistent checking**: All detection methods now check for skip environment variables consistently
- **Platform detection**: Improved platform detection to skip on headless/test environments

### 4. Removed Redundant Operations

- **Eliminated duplicate calls**: Removed redundant calls to system detection
- **Streamlined initialization**: Simplified the initialization chain to prevent multiple blocking operations

## Files Modified

### Core Changes

1. **src/Accessibility/FluentAccessibilityManager.cpp**
   - Made `detectSystemAccessibilitySettings()` call asynchronous in constructor
   - Added `detectSystemAccessibilitySettingsAsync()` method
   - Updated `onSystemAccessibilityChanged()` to use async detection
   - Added support for `FLUENTQT_SKIP_ACCESSIBILITY_DETECTION` environment variable

2. **include/FluentQt/Accessibility/FluentAccessibilityManager.h**
   - Added `detectSystemAccessibilitySettingsAsync()` private slot declaration

3. **src/Accessibility/FluentAccessibilityCompliance.cpp**
   - Made registry access asynchronous in constructor
   - Added comprehensive error handling with try-catch blocks
   - Added `detectSystemAccessibilitySettingsAsync()` method
   - Wrapped Windows registry operations in error handling
   - Added fallback default values for failed registry access

4. **include/FluentQt/Accessibility/FluentAccessibilityCompliance.h**
   - Added `detectSystemAccessibilitySettingsAsync()` private slot declaration

5. **src/Accessibility/FluentScreenReaderManager.cpp**
   - Made screen reader detection asynchronous in constructor
   - Updated `onSystemAccessibilityChanged()` to use async detection
   - Added support for skip environment variables

6. **src/Accessibility/FluentAccessible.cpp**
   - Made screen reader detection call asynchronous during initialization
   - Deferred Windows API calls (`FindWindow`) to avoid blocking UI thread
   - Added async timing to prevent startup blocking

### Test Files

7. **examples/AccessibilityStartupTest.cpp** (New)
   - Test program to verify startup doesn't freeze
   - Demonstrates proper accessibility initialization
   - Auto-tests accessibility functionality after startup

8. **docs/ACCESSIBILITY_STARTUP_FIX.md** (This file)
   - Documentation of the fix and testing procedures

## Testing the Fix

### Method 1: Environment Variable Skip

To completely skip accessibility detection during testing:

```bash
set FLUENTQT_SKIP_ACCESSIBILITY_DETECTION=1
FluentQtDemo.exe
```

### Method 2: Run Test Program

Build and run the test program:

```bash
# Build the test program
qmake examples/AccessibilityStartupTest.cpp
make

# Run the test
./AccessibilityStartupTest
```

### Method 3: Normal Startup Test

Run FluentQtDemo normally and verify:
1. Application starts without freezing
2. "FluentAccessibilityManager initialized" appears in debug output
3. "Starting asynchronous system accessibility detection" appears shortly after
4. Application UI is responsive during startup

## Expected Behavior After Fix

1. **Fast Startup**: Application starts immediately without hanging
2. **Async Detection**: System accessibility detection happens in background
3. **Error Resilience**: Registry access failures don't crash or freeze the application
4. **Maintained Functionality**: All accessibility features continue to work normally
5. **Debug Output**: Clear logging shows the async detection process

## Debug Output Example

```
FluentAccessibilityManager initialized
Starting asynchronous system accessibility detection
Detecting system accessibility settings
System accessibility detection completed - High contrast: false Reduced motion: false Screen reader: false
Asynchronous system accessibility detection completed
```

## Environment Variables

- `FLUENTQT_SKIP_PROCESS_DETECTION`: Skip all process detection (existing)
- `FLUENTQT_SKIP_ACCESSIBILITY_DETECTION`: Skip accessibility system detection (new)
- `QT_QPA_PLATFORM=offscreen`: Automatically skips detection for headless testing

## Backward Compatibility

- All existing accessibility functionality is preserved
- API remains unchanged
- Environment variable behavior is enhanced but backward compatible
- No breaking changes to public interfaces

## Performance Impact

- **Startup Time**: Significantly improved - no blocking registry access
- **Memory Usage**: Minimal increase due to async timers
- **Runtime Performance**: No impact on normal operation
- **Error Recovery**: Better resilience to system configuration issues
