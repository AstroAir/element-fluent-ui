Build the complete project from scratch and systematically fix all issues encountered during the
build process. This includes:

1. **Initial Assessment**: First examine the project structure, identify the build system (npm,
   yarn, pnpm, etc.), and check for existing configuration files (package.json, tsconfig.json,
   webpack.config.js, etc.)

2. **Dependency Installation**: Install all required dependencies using the appropriate package
   manager, ensuring compatibility between versions

3. **Build Execution**: Run the build command and capture all error messages, warnings, and build
   failures

4. **Issue Resolution**: For each error or issue encountered:
   - Analyze the root cause of the problem
   - Research the specific error message and context
   - Implement the appropriate fix (code changes, configuration updates, dependency adjustments)
   - Test the fix by re-running the build

5. **Iterative Process**: Continue the build-fix-rebuild cycle until the project builds successfully
   without errors

6. **Verification**: Once the build completes successfully, verify that:
   - All build artifacts are generated correctly
   - No critical warnings remain
   - The built project can run/start properly if applicable

7. **Documentation**: Provide a summary of all issues found and how they were resolved

Please work through this systematically, showing each step of the process and explaining what issues
were found and how they were fixed.
