I will provide you with a UI component that needs to be optimized to better align with Microsoft's
Fluent UI design system. Please analyze the component and make the following improvements:

1. **Design System Compliance**: Ensure the component follows Fluent UI design principles,
   including:
   - Proper spacing, typography, and color usage according to Fluent UI tokens
   - Consistent visual hierarchy and layout patterns
   - Appropriate use of Fluent UI components and styling conventions

2. **Interface Completeness**: Review and ensure the component's API is complete by:
   - Verifying all necessary props are exposed and properly typed
   - Adding any missing accessibility attributes (ARIA labels, roles, etc.)
   - Ensuring proper event handlers and callbacks are implemented
   - Validating that the component supports all expected use cases

3. **Code Quality**: Optimize the implementation for:
   - Performance and efficiency
   - Maintainability and readability
   - Proper error handling and edge cases
   - TypeScript type safety (if applicable)

4. **Documentation**: Provide clear explanations of:
   - What changes were made and why
   - How the updated component better aligns with Fluent UI standards
   - Any breaking changes or migration notes if applicable

Please analyze the current implementation first, then provide the optimized version with detailed
explanations of the improvements made.
